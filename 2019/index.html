<h1>High-Performance Graphics 2019</h1>
<h4>Thanks for a wonderful conference! See you July 16-18, 2020 in Washington, D.C.!</h4>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2019! High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, and hardware architecture. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of massively parallel hardware, novel programming models, efficient graphics algorithms, and novel applications.</p>
<p>High Performance Graphics 2019 will be co-located with the <a href="http://egsr2019.icube.unistra.fr/">Eurographics Symposium on Rendering</a> in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>This year High Performance Graphics, in league with Facebook Reality Labs, is introducing a new student scholarship program for funding travel and expenses to attend the HPG 2019 conference, to a select group of students from underrepresented groups working in graphics and related research areas. Please visit our <a href="/2019/diversity">diversity scholarship page</a> for more details!</p>
<p>High-Performance Graphics was founded in 2009 to synthesize and broaden on two important and well-respected conferences in computer graphics: <a href="https://www.graphicshardware.org/"><strong>Graphics Hardware</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/rt08/"><strong>Interactive Ray Tracing</strong></a></p>
