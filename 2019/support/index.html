<h1>Support</h1>
<p>High-Performance Graphics is a highly visible, international forum, with established roots, for exchanging experience and knowledge related to computer graphics algorithms, hardware, and systems. The event offers a unique perspective on graphics by combining discussions and constructive critique of innovative concepts as well as product-level designs.</p>
