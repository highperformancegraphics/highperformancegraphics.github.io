<h1>Accommodations</h1>
<p>A list of selected hotels is available <a href="/wp-content/uploads/hotels_2019_strasbourg.pdf">here</a>. Hotel names prefixed with a red asterisk offer reduced prices for the conference. Please note that the list contains the original prices without the discount applied. To benefit from that reduced price, you need to contact them directly via email or phone, and say you benefit from the “Université de Strasbourg &#8211; Service Formation Continue” prices; those reduced prices are not always available (during European Parliament sessions for example), so check with the hotel. If you decide to call a hotel, do not forget to prefix the phone number with the country code +33.</p>
<p>Please also check with alternative booking platforms to get the optimal rates for your stay.</p>
