<h1>Diversity Scholarship</h1>
<p>Please note that application is closed for this HPG!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>High-Performance Graphics, in league with Facebook Reality Labs, is introducing a new student scholarship program for funding travel and expenses to attend the HPG 2019 conference, to a select group of students from underrepresented groups working in graphics and related research areas. Our program provides travel and registration scholarships to HPG, being held in beautiful Strasbourg, France, July 8th-10th.</p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">We invite recipients of scholarships to present a research poster describing new work in computer graphics. This will yield you some visibility, and the opportunity to receive valuable feedback and encouragement. Please consider this opportunity, and see the posters section in our <a href="/2019/call-for-participation">CFP</a>.  Please note that the poster deadlines do not apply for diversity students, w</span></span>e will accept student posters coming from the diversity program after the official poster deadline.</p>
<h2>Program Information</h2>
<p>We aim to fund junior students, broadly in high-performance computer graphics and related research areas (high-performance computer vision, machine learning, compiler and language technology). Eligible students are Ph.D. students in the first few years of their program, strong master’s students, and strong undergraduate students who are genuinely interested in research. We offer three scholarship tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full scholarships &#8211; 3,500 dollars reimbursement of eligible travel expenses</li>
<li>Half scholarships &#8211; 1,750 dollars reimbursement of eligible travel expenses</li>
<li>Registration scholarships &#8211; Free registration to the conference (ideal for students local to the Strasbourg region).</li>
</ul>
<p>Eligible expenses include air or ground transportation, meals, and hotel or other lodging costs. In order to be fully reimbursed the attendee must register for the conference (select the ‘Diversity scholarship’ category during Step 1), check in, and attend the entire conference (to the best of their ability), a special introduction and lunch event for scholarship recipients.</p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<p>The application process will be a bit informal as this is our first year implementing the program. If you qualify as a member of an underrepresented group, please consider applying! We define underrepresented loosely as including, but not limited to, race/ethnicity, gender, disability status, nationality, and socioeconomic background.</p>
