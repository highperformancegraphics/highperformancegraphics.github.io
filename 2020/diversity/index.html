<h1>Diversity Scholarship</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>HPG extends a diversity scholarship for funding expenses to attend the conference. The scholarship application is open to individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM, working in computer graphics and related research areas. High-Performance Graphics 2020 will take place online, and as such, the scholarship program for 2020 will not include travel expense reimbursement. Applicants will instead be applying for a grant for premium registration to the conference.</p>
<h2>Scholarship Information</h2>
<p>Eligible applicants should identify with underrepresented groups in STEM, and be genuinely interested in research. We define underrepresented loosely as including, but <b>not limited to</b>, race/ethnicity, gender, disability status, nationality, and socioeconomic backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in STEM. If you identify as underrepresented, please consider applying!</p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<p>An HPG subcommittee makes decisions to accept applications to the program based on the responses to two essay questions and any additionally provided information. The application material requirements are described below.</p>
<p>Note: since HPG is taking place online and registration is much less expensive this year (2020), we have abbreviated the application. We realize some applicants have already and prepared and submitted the original application material, and upon acceptance may wish to note this on their CV for prospects. For entities looking to verify the full application process for such applicants please see https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2019/diversity/</p>
