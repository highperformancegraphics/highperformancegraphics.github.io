<h1>Call for Participation</h1>
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2020. High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, compilers, parallelism, and hardware architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.</p>
<h2><b>Conference Info</b></h2>
<p>High-Performance Graphics is co-sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH and Eurographics. The program features a week of paper and industry presentations.</p>
<p>The conference will be online this year and will take place on July 13-16, 2020. All presentations, including invited talks, paper talks, posters, and Hot3D talks will be streamed online as videos. The conference will also provide an online video conferencing option for live interactions with speakers.</p>
<h2><b>Papers Track</b></h2>

<h2><b>Paper Submission Information</b></h2>
<p>HPG has a single track for paper submission. All accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/pub.cfm?id=J1615">Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACMCGIT)</a> journal.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to upload papers electronically in Adobe PDF format by visiting the submission area. Submissions must be anonymous (in which the paper contains no identifying information). Video sequences in standard formats may be submitted using the electronic submission system. Dual submission to other peer-reviewed conferences or journals is not allowed; any paper submitted to another peer-reviewed venue and under consideration during the HPG review cycle will be rejected.</p>
<p>Submitted papers will be evaluated by the International Program Committee and external reviewers using double-blind peer review. There is no rebuttal process. All submissions will either be conditionally accepted with a list of mandatory changes or rejected. Conditionally accepted papers will receive a talk slot at the conference.</p>
<p>Conditionally accepted papers will require a second round of peer review to verify that the mandatory changes have been implemented. This second round will be single-blind. We will offer a fast track option for the second round with a shortened timeline for authors to implement the mandatory changes. Papers that receive final acceptance within the fast track timeline will be provided to the attendees as preprints.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: papers@highperformancegraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Paper Length and Format</b></h2>
<p>Papers should be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines</a> and use the “acmsmall” style for the PACMCGIT journal.</p>
<p>There is no fixed maximum length for a paper. However, the magnitude of the contribution must be proportional to the length of the paper.</p>
<p>Writing plays an important role in the assessment. Omitting important details or tampering with formatting rules may cause a paper to be graded lower than a longer paper that is clearly written, without being repetitive or verbose.</p>
<h2><b>Hot 3D Systems Track</b></h2>
<p>We invite vendors in the graphics industry to submit presentations of their latest and greatest graphics chips, high-performance software, and system designs. Presentations should be 20 minutes long, with a focus on technical aspects of real products (marketing-oriented talks will no be accepted). Hot 3D presentations are not considered archival publications for the purposes of future submission to peer-reviewed venues.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: hot3d@highperformancegraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Posters</b></h2>
<p>We also invite the submission of posters describing ongoing or late-breaking work. In addition to traditional posters, this session will be enhanced to provide opportunities for paper authors to present implementation details or hands-on demonstrations.</p>
<h3><b>Poster Submission Info</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare an extended abstract (two page maximum) that summarizes the work using the acmart sigconf paper format.</li>
<li>Prepare a high-quality version of the final poster.</li>
<li>Send both items (in PDF format) to posters@highperformancegraphics.org.</li>
</ol>
<p>For further information please contact: posters@highperformancegraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Important Dates</b></h2>
<p>All deadlines are at 22:00 UTC/GMT</p>

<p><b>Wolfgang Strasser Best Paper Award</b></p>
<p>An award of $1000 will be given to the authors of the most outstanding paper presented at the event. The award is based on the accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical concept, the quality and readability of the manuscript, as well as the content and delivery of the verbal presentation. The winner will be chosen by the organizing committee based on audience feedback and will be announced at the end of the conference.</p>
<h2><b>Demonstrations</b></h2>
<p>Presenters and participants are invited to bring prototypes and products for demonstration at the event. Demonstrations will be held during breaks, during the poster session, and before and after the sessions. We highly encourage paper authors and industry presenters to demonstrate their systems. Please contact the organizing committee by email at general@highperformancegraphics.org to arrange for space or electrical connections that may be required for your demonstration.</p>
<h2><b>Student Competition</b></h2>
<p>Please refer to the<a href="https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2020/student-competition/"> student competition page</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Diversity Scholarship</b></h2>
<p>HPG now extends a diversity scholarship program for funding travel and expenses to attend the conference. The scholarship application will be open to individuals in underrepresented groups working in graphics and related research areas. Our program provides both travel and registration scholarships to HPG. For information on the program and how to apply see <a href="https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2020/diversity/">Diversity Scholarship page</a>.</p>
