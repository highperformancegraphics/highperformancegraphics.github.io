<h1>Venue</h1>
<p>HPG 2014 will be in held in <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Lyon">Lyon, France</a> at the <a href="http://www.univ-lyon2.fr/culture/les-lieux-culturels/grand-amphi/le-grand-amphitheatre-un-cadre-prestigieux-391971.kjsp">Grand Amphitheater</a> of  the <a href="http://www.univ-lyon2.fr/">Université Lumière Lyon 2</a>, a member institution of the <a href="http://lyon-university.org/">University of Lyon</a>. The hall is situated in the center of the city and is easy reached by air, train or car. There is ample public transportation, above and below ground, including a train from the airport. During the conference, lunch and coffee breaks will be provided.</p>
<p>Lyon is a great city to <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Lyon">visit</a> as a <a href="https://www.en.lyon-france.com/">tourist</a>. As an UNESCO World Heritage Site, there are well-preserved elements of architecture and history to see and explore from all periods of the city&#8217;s development. Famously, this includes its founding as the Roman city of Lugdunum and its importance in the silk weaving trade starting during the Renaissance. (Lyon is a great place to see a working Jacquard&#8217;s loom with its chain of punch cards!) This is, of course, all in the context of a modern, well-equipped city full of attractions, art, cuisine, shopping and leisure services. The surrounding area includes many outdoor and rural activities, including the varied <a href="https://www.pilat-tourisme.fr/">Pilat Regional Natural Park</a>.</p>
<p>This year, the conference&#8217;s traditional banquet will be held at <a href="http://www.chateaudenvaux.fr/">Château d&#8217;Envaux</a> in the Beaujolais region, north of Lyon. You can look forward to a visit to the vineyard and an excellent meal in beautiful surroundings. Transportation will be provided.</p>
