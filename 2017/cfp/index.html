<h1>Call For Participation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2017. High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, compilers, parallelism, hardware, and architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.</p>
<p>This year we are introducing a <strong>special session on languages and compilers</strong>, recognizing their increasingly important role in leveraging high performance architectures. This session will include invited talks from the industry and academia as well as selected papers from the papers track.</p>
<h2><b>Conference Info</b></h2>
<p>High-Performance Graphics is co-sponsored by Eurographics and ACM SIGGRAPH. The program features three days of paper and industry presentations, with ample time for discussions during breaks, lunches, and the conference banquet. The conference is co-located with <a href="https://s2017.siggraph.org">SIGGRAPH 2017</a> in Los Angeles, USA, and will take place on July 28-30, 2017.</p>
<h2><b>Papers Track</b></h2>

<h2><b>Papers Length and Format</b></h2>
<p>There is no fixed maximum length for a paper. However, the magnitude of the contribution must be proportional to the length of the paper. Papers longer than ten typeset pages in the final format must make a very significant contribution to be accepted. Writing plays an important role in the assessment. Omitting important details or tampering with formatting rules may cause a paper to be graded lower than a longer paper that is clearly written, without being repetitive or verbose. Papers of four or fewer pages will be held to a less strict standard of citation and description of related work (comparison to the strongest alternative techniques is still important, but an exhaustive review is not necessary). Published proceedings will be archived in the ACM and Eurographics Digital Libraries.</p>
<h2><b>Paper Submission Info</b></h2>
<p>Authors are invited to upload papers electronically in Adobe PDF format by visiting <a href="/2017/submissions/">the submissions area</a>. We encourage anonymous submissions (in which the paper contains no identifying information) if possible. Video sequences in QuickTime, MPEG, or AVI format may be submitted using the electronic submission system. Dual submission is not allowed; any paper submitted to another venue and under consideration during the HPG review cycle will be rejected. Papers and short papers should be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines</a> and use the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM LaTeX template</a> for SIGGRAPH proceedings. A minimum latex template according to the above guidelines can be found <a href="/2017/wp-content/uploads/hpg2017confTemplate.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: <a href="mailto:papers@HighPerformanceGraphics.org">papers@HighPerformanceGraphics.org</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Special Session on Languages and Compilers</b></h2>
<p>This year we are introducing a special session with a focus on programming models, languages, and compilation techniques. In this session, leaders from the industry and academia will present their latest work on systems that exploit novel architectures, language and compiler techniques for high-performance graphics, vision, and image processing. The session will also include presentations on selected papers from the papers track.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: <a href="mailto:specialsession@HighPerformanceGraphics.org">specialsession@HighPerformanceGraphics.org</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Hot 3D Systems Track</b></h2>
<p>We invite vendors in the graphics industry to submit presentations of their latest and greatest graphics chips, high-performance software, and system designs. Presentations should be 20 minutes long, technical rather than marketing-oriented, and with a focus on real products. Hot 3D presentations are not considered archival publications for the purposes of future submission to peer-reviewed venues.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: <a href="mailto:hot3d@HighPerformanceGraphics.org">hot3d@HighPerformanceGraphics.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="posters"><b>Posters</b></h2>
<p>We also invite the submission of posters describing on-going or late-breaking work. In addition to traditional posters, this session will be enhanced to provide opportunities for paper authors to present implementation details or hands-on demonstrations.</p>
<h3><b>Poster Submission Info</b></h3>
<p>To submit a poster, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Prepare an extended abstract (one page maximum) that summarizes the work using the paper format described above. This allows potential poster authors to submit the idea of their work without requiring a full poster by the submission deadline. Accepted abstract authors will be required to produce a high-quality final poster version for display at the conference.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style: none;"><strong>OR</strong></ul>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a high-quality version of the final poster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send one or both items (in PDF format) to <a href="mailto:posters@HighPerformanceGraphics.org">posters@HighPerformanceGraphics.org</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Additional information:</b></h3>
<p>Posters will be exhibited in the break areas throughout the conference. For each poster, we will attempt to make space available for interactive demonstrations (if necessary and only upon request). Poster authors will be responsible for printing the poster, bringing it to the conference, and putting it up. Easels will be provided.</p>
<p>In order to protect authors’ right to submit their work for publication as a full paper elsewhere, we will not be publishing a poster abstract with the HPG proceedings. This will hopefully prevent future reviewers from claiming that your work is already published. However, we will include author names and the title of the poster.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: <a href="mailto:posters@HighPerformanceGraphics.org">posters@HighPerformanceGraphics.org</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Important Dates</b></h2>
<p>All deadlines are at 22:00 UTC/GMT.</p>

<h2><b>Wolfgang Strasser Best Paper Award</b></h2>
<p>An award of $750 will be given to the authors of the most outstanding paper presented at the event. The award is based on the accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical concept, the quality and readability of the manuscript, as well as the content and delivery of the verbal presentation. The winner will be chosen by the organizing committee based on audience feedback and will be announced at the end of the conference.</p>
<h2><b>Demonstrations</b></h2>
<p>Presenters and participants are invited to bring prototypes and products for demonstration at the event. Demonstrations will be held during breaks and before and after the sessions. We highly encourage paper authors and industry presenters to demonstrate their systems. Please contact the organizing committee by email at <a href="mailto:general@HighPerformanceGraphics.org">general@HighPerformanceGraphics.org</a> to arrange for space or electrical connections that may be required for your demonstration.</p>
