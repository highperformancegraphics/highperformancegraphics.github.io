<h1>High-Performance Graphics 2017</h1>
<h4>Thanks for a wonderful conference! See you August 10-12, 2018 in Vancouver, Canada!</h4>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2017! High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, and hardware architecture. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of massively parallel hardware, novel programming models, efficient graphics algorithms, and novel applications.</p>
<p>High-Performance Graphics was founded in 2009 to synthesize and broaden on two important and well-respected conferences in computer graphics: <a href="https://www.graphicshardware.org/"><strong>Graphics Hardware</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/rt08/"><strong>Interactive Ray Tracing</strong></a></p>
<p>The conference will take place at the Sheraton Grand Los Angeles on July 28-30 in Los Angeles, USA.</p>
