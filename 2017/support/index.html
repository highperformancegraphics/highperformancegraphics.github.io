<h1>Support</h1>
<p>High-Performance Graphics is a highly visible, international forum, with established roots, for exchanging experience and knowledge related to computer graphics algorithms, hardware, and systems. The event offers a unique perspective on graphics by combining discussions and constructive critique of innovative concepts as well as product-level designs. The 2017 High Performance Graphics conference will especially continue to deepen our coverage of compilers, languages, programming systems as they apply to 3D graphics. This year we are co-located with SIGGRAPH, and will be held in Los Angeles July 28-30, 2017.</p>
<p>Your contributions are specifically used to acquire the necessary audio/visual services, provide a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere during the conference banquet and lunches, to allow low-cost student registrations, and to provide the best paper prize.</p>
