During the past few years, Deep Learning has made significant progress towards solving many difficult Artificial Intelligence tasks. Although the techniques behind deep learning have been studied for decades, they rely on large datasets and large computational resources, and so have only recently become practically applicable. Training deep neural networks is very computationally intensive: training one model takes tens of exaflops of work. The more models we train, the more hypotheses we can evaluate about how to solve our problems, and the more research progress we can make. Accordingly, we care a great deal about reducing training time &#8211; so High Performance Computing is central to our work. Once we have a good model, we deploy it to users, which is also a computationally intensive problem. Therefore, throughput oriented processors and associated programming models are central to the current and future success of deep learning. In this talk, I will discuss the use of GPUs for training and deploying deep learning models. I&#8217;ll talk about the directions I think deep learning is leading GPU hardware and programming models.<br />
<b>Bio</b><br />
Bryan is a research scientist at Baidu, working with Adam Coates and Andrew Ng to create next generation systems for training and deploying deep learning.<br />
He earned his PhD from Berkeley, under the direction of Kurt Keutzer, where he built the Copperhead language and compiler, which allows Python programmers to use nested data parallel abstractions and gain high efficiency on contemporary parallel platforms. He earned his MS and BS from Brigham Young University, where he worked with Brent Nelson on higher radix floating-point representations for FPGAs.<br />

<b>Abstract: The Technology to Create the Magic</b><br />
Disney Research was launched in 2008 as a network of research laboratories that collaborate closely with academic institutions such as the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and Carnegie Mellon University. Its mission is to push the frontiers of technology in areas relevant to Disney&#8217;s creative entertainment businesses. Disney Research develops innovations for Parks, Film, Animation, Television, Games, and Consumer Products. Research areas include video and  animation technologies, postproduction and special effects, digital fabrication, robotics, and much more. This talk gives an overview of Disney Research spiced with some examples of our latest and greatest inventions. The focus is on the collaboration between ETH Zurich and the Walt Disney Company displaying the synergies arising from this program. This talk will highlight a company perspective as well as a view from the academic angle.<br />

Before joining Disney, Gross was director of the Institute of Computational Sciences at ETH. He received a master of science in electrical and computer engineering and a PhD in computer graphics and image analysis, both from Saarland University in Germany in 1986 and 1989. Gross serves on the boards of numerous international research institutes, societies, and governmental organizations. He received the Technical Achievement Award from EUROGRAPHICS in 2010, the Swiss ICT Champions Award in 2011 and the IEEE Visualization Technical Achievement Award in 2015. He is a fellow of the ACM and of the EUROGRAPHICS Association and a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina as well as the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In 2013 he received a Technical Achievement Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Konrad Zuse Medal of GI and the Karl Heinz Beckurts price.
