<h1>Call For Participation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2016. High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, parallelism, compilers, parallelism, hardware and architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.</p>
<h2><b>Conference Info</b></h2>
<p>High Performance Graphics is co-sponsored by Eurographics and ACM SIGGRAPH. The program features three days of paper and industry presentations, with ample time for discussions during breaks, lunches, and the conference banquet. The conference is co-located with <a href="http://egsr2016.scss.tcd.ie/index.php/home">EGSR 2016</a> in Dublin, Ireland, and will take place on June 20-22, 2016.</p>
<h2><b>Papers Track</b></h2>
<p>We invite original and innovative performance-oriented contributions to the design of hardware architectures, programming systems, and algorithms for all areas of graphics, including rendering, virtual and augmented reality, ray-tracing, physics, animation, and visual computing. We also invite contributions to the emerging area of high-performance computer vision and image processing for graphics applications. A selection of the papers will be invited to submit extended versions to Computer Graphics Forum. Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>

<li>Novel applications of GPU computing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Papers Length and Format</b></h2>
<p>There is no fixed maximum length for a paper. However, the magnitude of the contribution must be proportional to the length of the paper. Papers longer than ten typeset pages in the final format must make a very significant contribution to be accepted. Writing plays an important role in the assessment.  Omitting important details or tampering with formatting rules may cause a paper to be graded lower than a longer paper that is clearly written, without being repetitive or verbose. Papers of four or fewer pages will be held to a less strict standard of citation and description of related work (comparison to the strongest alternative techniques is still important, but an exhaustive review is not necessary). The papers will be archived in the ACM and Eurographics Digital Libraries.</p>
<h2><b>Paper Submission Info</b></h2>
<p>Authors are invited to upload papers electronically in Adobe PDF format by visiting<a href="/2016/submissions/"> the submissions area</a>. We encourage anonymous submissions (in which the paper contains no identifying information) if possible. Video sequences in QuickTime, MPEG, or AVI format may be submitted using the electronic submission system. Dual submission is not allowed; any paper submitted to another venue and under consideration during the HPG review cycle will be rejected. Papers and short papers should be formatted according to the<a href="/2016/wp-content/uploads/egPublStyle-HPG2016.zip"> HPG 2016 Paper Template and Guidelines</a>. We recommend using the templates given there.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: papers@HighPerformanceGraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Hot 3D Systems Track</b></h2>
<p>We invite vendors in the graphics industry to submit presentations of their latest and greatest graphics chips, high-performance software, and system designs. Presentations should be 20 minutes long, technical rather than marketing-oriented, and with a focus on real products. Hot 3D presentations are not considered archival publications for the purposes of future submission to peer-reviewed venues.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: hot3d@HighPerformanceGraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Posters</b></h2>
<p>We also invite the submission of posters describing on-going or late-breaking work. In addition to traditional posters, this session will be enhanced to provide opportunities for paper authors to present implementation details or hands-on demonstrations.</p>
<h3><b>Poster Submission Info</b></h3>
<p>To submit a poster, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare an extended abstract (one page maximum) that summarizes the work using the paper format described above.</li>
<li>Prepare a high-quality version of the final poster.</li>
<li>Send both items (in PDF format) to posters@HighPerformanceGraphics.org.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Additional information:</b></h3>
<p>Posters will be exhibited in the break areas throughout the conference. For each poster, we will attempt to make space available for interactive demonstrations (if necessary and only upon request). Poster authors will be responsible for printing the poster, bringing it to the conference, and putting it up. Easels will be provided.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: posters@HighPerformanceGraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Important Dates</b></h2>
<p>All deadlines are at 11:59 PM GMT-7 (PDT).</p>

<h2><b>Wolfgang Strasser Best Paper Award</b></h2>
<p>An award of $750 will be given to the authors of the most outstanding paper presented at the event. The award is based on the accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical concept, the quality and readability of the manuscript, as well as the content and delivery of the verbal presentation. The winner will be chosen by the organizing committee based on audience feedback and will be announced at the end of the conference.</p>
<h2><b>Demonstrations</b></h2>
<p>Presenters and participants are invited to bring prototypes and products for demonstration at the event. Demonstrations will be held during breaks and before and after the sessions. We highly encourage paper authors and industry presenters to demonstrate their systems. Please contact the organizing committee by email at <a href="mailto:general@HighPerformanceGraphics.org"> general@HighPerformanceGraphics.org</a> to arrange for space or electrical connections that may be required for your demonstration.</p>
