<h2>Note</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>To take advantage of the student rate, you must already be an ACM / SIGGRAPH or Eurographics student member with a currently active membership number. If you are not yet a member, the cost is quite low, making it worth your while even if only for this one conference. There are however numerous other benefits. Please see <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/membership">SIGGRAPH Membership</a>, <a href="https://www.acm.org/membership/student/">ACM Student Membership</a>, and <a href="https://www.eg.org/index.php/membership/membership">Eurographics Membership</a> for more details and instructions on joining.</em></li>
