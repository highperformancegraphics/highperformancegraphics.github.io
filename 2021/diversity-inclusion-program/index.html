<h1>Diversity &#038; Inclusion Program</h1>
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Creating diverse environments with people from a multitude of backgrounds has time and again proven to create the most fertile ground for creativity, productivity, and innovation. Since we at High Performance Graphics (HPG) have committed ourselves to generate these environments even in those daring times. To do so, we will in 2021 launch the HPG Diversity &amp; Inclusion Program during the conference.</p>
<p>This will be split into two separate sessions. During the first session, selected professionals from different underrepresented groups will take the stage to talk about their paths into and through the field of high performance graphics, from academic research to game development. During the following Career Mentoring &amp; Advice Sessions, applicants will get a chance to meet with and receive personal feedback from professionals in the field.</p>
<h2><b>“Diversity Within High Performance Graphics”-Panel</b></h2>
<p>Bringing together people from various backgrounds and different life experiences generates more creative and innovative ideas by opening up perspectives that others may have not considered.</p>
<p>In this panel, listen to some invited professionals from diverse backgrounds and different career paths in the HPG community. By hearing about their unique experiences in the field as part of an underrepresented group, we wish to inspire and encourage young students and professionals to set their own goals, and to see that nothing should limit the height of these goals.</p>
<p>The panel will be a <b>1h plenary session</b> to which everyone is invited. We especially encourage undergraduate students to participate.</p>

<h2><b>Career Mentoring &amp; Advice Sessions</b></h2>
<p>After the plenary panel, a selected group of applicants from underrepresented groups will be invited to join a special personal session with our speakers and other senior career professionals. You will have a chance to ask personal questions, learn about career paths, discuss opportunities, talk about your own work, and maybe even get some feedback on your CV or how to promote your student project. This is a unique opportunity to meet with researchers and professionals in the field to talk about your goals and aspirations. We encourage students and those early in their career to apply.</p>
