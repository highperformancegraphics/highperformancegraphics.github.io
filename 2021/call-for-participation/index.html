<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p><span>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2021. High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, compilers, parallelism, and hardware architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conference Info</b></h2>
<p><span>High-Performance Graphics is co-sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH and Eurographics. The program features a week of paper and industry presentations.</span></p>
<p><span>The conference will be online this year and will take place on July 6-9, 2021. All presentations, including invited talks, paper talks, posters, and Hot3D talks will be streamed online as videos. The conference will also provide an online video conferencing option for live interactions with speakers.</span></p>
<h2><b>Papers Track</b></h2>

<h2><b>Paper Submission Information</b></h2>
<p><span>HPG has a single track for paper submission. The top 30% of all submitted papers will be accepted to a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, the journal of the Eurographics Association. Furthermore, all papers will be published in both the ACM and the EG Online Digital Library.</span></p>
<p><span>Authors are invited to upload papers electronically in Adobe PDF format by using the EG SRM system. Submissions must be anonymous (in which the paper contains no identifying information). Video sequences in standard formats may be submitted using the electronic submission system. Dual submission to other peer-reviewed conferences or journals is not allowed; any paper submitted to another peer-reviewed venue and under consideration during the HPG review cycle will be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span>Submitted papers will be evaluated by the International Program Committee and external reviewers using double-blind peer review. There is no rebuttal process. All submissions will either be 1) conditionally accepted with a list of mandatory changes for publication in CGF, 2) accepted or 3) rejected. All accepted papers will receive a talk slot at the conference.</span></p>
<p><span>Papers conditionally accepted to CGF will require a second round of peer review to verify that the mandatory changes have been implemented. This second round will be single-blind.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information please contact: papers@highperformancegraphics.org.</span></p>
<h2><b>Paper Length and Format</b></h2>
<p><span>Papers should be formatted according to the Computer Graphics Forum template provided by the SRM submission system.</span></p>
<p><span>There is no fixed maximum length for a paper. However, the magnitude of the contribution must be proportional to the length of the paper.</span></p>
<p><span>Writing plays an important role in the assessment. Omitting important details or tampering with formatting rules may cause a paper to be graded lower than a longer paper that is clearly written, without being repetitive or verbose.</span></p>
<h2><b>Submission Guidelines</b></h2>
<p><span>We try to be as permissive as possible while still taking all reasonable steps to preserve anonymity during the review process. Please do not make public statements on the submission status of your paper until acceptance has been confirmed. Before your paper is accepted:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You may upload a version of your submission, for example as a technical report or to arXiv (or similar services), but please do not mention HPG.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You may give presentations about your work, without saying it is submitted to HPG.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.</span></p>
<h2><b>Hot 3D Systems Track</b></h2>
<p><span>We invite vendors in the graphics industry to submit presentations of their latest and greatest graphics chips, high-performance software, and system designs. Presentations should be 20 minutes long, with a focus on technical aspects of real products (marketing-oriented talks will not be accepted). Hot 3D presentations are not considered archival publications for the purposes of future submission to peer-reviewed venues.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information please contact: hot3d@highperformancegraphics.org.</span></p>
<h2><b>Posters</b></h2>
<p><span>We also invite the submission of posters describing ongoing or late-breaking work. In addition to traditional posters, this session will be enhanced to provide opportunities for paper authors to present implementation details or hands-on demonstrations. Please note that posters are not considered archival publications and thus should not prevent submitting the work therein to other publication venues. </span></p>
<h3><b>Poster Submission Info</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare an extended abstract (two pages maximum) that summarizes the work using the template provided <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/HPG_2021/GetConferenceFile?fileID=12334" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/HPG_2021/GetConferenceFile?fileID%3D12334&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623516190897000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlh1as1mgX_hoN83Hd40GGfTgwVw">here</a>. If your paper was a rejected HPG submission from this year you are allowed to resubmit the original submission in place of the extended abstract.</li>
<li>Send the abstract (or your HPG rejected paper) in PDF format to <a href="mailto:posters@highperformancegraphics.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posters@<wbr />highperformancegraphics.org</a>.</li>
<li>You are allowed to prepare the high-quality version of the final poster after receiving the notification of acceptance.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>For further information please contact: posters@highperformancegraphics.org.</span></p>
<h2><b>Wolfgang Strasser Best Paper Award</b></h2>
<p><span>An award of $1000 will be given to the authors of the most outstanding paper presented at the event. The award is based on the accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical concept, the quality and readability of the manuscript, as well as the content and delivery of the verbal presentation. The winner will be chosen by the organizing committee based on audience feedback and will be announced at the end of the conference.</span></p>
