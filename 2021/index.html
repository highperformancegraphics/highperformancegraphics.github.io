<h1>High-Performance Graphics 2021</h1>
<p>High-Performance Graphics was founded in 2009 to synthesize and broaden two important and well-respected conferences in computer graphics: <a href="https://www.graphicshardware.org/"><strong>Graphics Hardware</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/rt08/"><strong>Interactive Ray Tracing</strong></a></p>
<p>Thank you everybody for contributing and attending HPG 2021! Links to the conference content are on the <a href="/2021/program/">program page</a>.</p>
<p>Next year’s HPG should be co-located with SIGGRAPH and will take place in Vancouver, BC, Canada next summer.</p>
