<h1>Support</h1>
<h2>Corporate Support</h2>
<p>High Performance Graphics is a highly visible, international forum, with established roots, for exchanging experience and knowledge related to computer graphics algorithms, hardware, and systems. The event offers a unique perspective on graphics by combining discussions and constructive critique of innovative concepts as well as product-level designs. It is an inclusive forum for the entire graphics community and brings together researchers, engineers, and architects.</p>
<p>Graphics Hardware and Interactive Ray Tracing, whose synthesis has germinated in the creation of High Performance graphics, had always enjoyed generous corporate support to provide a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere during the conference banquet and lunches, to allow low-cost student registrations, and to provide the best paper prize.</p>
<p>Supporting the conference demonstrates leadership and good will in the graphics community and provides an opportunity to recruit among the influential group of researchers, architects, engineers, and students who attend the conference.</p>
