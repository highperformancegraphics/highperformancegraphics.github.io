<p>We invite you to participate in our Shadertoy student competition. Entries from students at all levels are encouraged and will be eligible for our awards (see below)!</p>
<p>We provide an unoptimized path tracer implementation on <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ftXyD2">shadertoy</a>. The goal is to achieve the highest possible quality compared to a brute-force reference (100k samples per pixel) without a significant performance cost. In other words, submissions may increase the render time at most by a factor of 2, but will be ranked according to their image quality as measured per SSIM.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ftXyD2">Here is a link to our framework, where you can get started.</a></p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Submission deadline: June 27th, 12:00 PST</strong></p>
<p>Winners will be announced during the HPG conference.</p>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Please fork <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ftXyD2">our framework on shadertoy</a> and include “HPG 2022 student competition” in the title. Send a link to the shadertoy to <a href="mailto:studentcompetition@highperformancegraphics.org">studentcompetition@highperformancegraphics.org</a> with a short description of the optimizations you did perform. Please set the visibility to unlisted before the competition; we encourage you to set it to “public” afterwards.</p>
<p>Please note that upon submission you authorize HPG to display your shader during the conference as well as host it on the HPG 2022 website and Youtube channel. We will give proper attribution to the authors.</p>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>Anyone who is a student at the time the work is completed is welcome to participate. We encourage submissions from underrepresented groups in our community &mdash; please also see the HPG 2022 Diversity and Inclusion Program.</p>
<h2>Prizes</h2>
<p>We will have multiple GPUs from our sponsors as awards. More details to come!</p>
