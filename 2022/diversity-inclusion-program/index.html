<h1>Diversity &#038; Inclusion Program</h1>
<p>Creating diverse environments with people from a multitude of backgrounds has time and again proven to create the most fertile ground for creativity, productivity, and innovation. At High Performance Graphics (HPG) we have committed ourselves to generate these environments even in these daring times. To do so, we are announcing the HPG Diversity &amp; Inclusion Program during the conference in 2022.</p>
<p>More details will be here soon.</p>
