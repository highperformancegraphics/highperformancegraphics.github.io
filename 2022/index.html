<h1>High Performance Graphics 2022</h1>
<p><b>High-Performance Graphics (HPG) is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, compilers, parallelism, and hardware architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel and custom hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to announce that </span><b>HPG 2022</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be another </span><b>online conference</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, following the success of the past two years with record-breaking attendance. We will use interactive video conferencing for all talks, presentations, and social events.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference will be live on </span><b>July 11 through 14, 2022</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There will be a collection of invited talks, panels, peer-reviewed paper and poster presentations, and social events for attendees. We plan to have approximately 4 hours of conference content each day, starting early in the morning in the Pacific Time zone, which corresponds to afternoon in Europe and evening in most of Asia.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also planning an </span><b>in-person keynote and reception</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event as a part of the conference, which will be co-located with SIGGRAPH 2022 in Vancouver on Sunday, August 7, 2022. We hope to announce more details on this event in the Spring.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HPG is a high-impact venue for academic papers. All accepted HPG 2022 papers will be published in the ACM’s PACMCGIT journal. </span><b>The paper submission deadlines will be in late-April/early-May 2022.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Further details will be announced in our call for participation.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In HPG 2022, we plan to continue our tradition of providing </span><b>awards</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with prizes, such as the Wolfgang Straßer Best Paper Award, Test-of-Time Award, Best Poster Award, and Student Competition Award.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing you at HPG 2022!</span></p>
