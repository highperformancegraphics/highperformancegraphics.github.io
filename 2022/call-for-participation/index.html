<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2022. High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, compilers, parallelism, and hardware architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.</p>
<h2><b>Conference Info</b></h2>
<p>High-Performance Graphics is co-sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH and Eurographics. The program features a week of paper and industry presentations.</p>
<p>The conference will be online this year and will take place the week of July 11, 2022. All presentations will be streamed online. The conference will also provide an online video conferencing option for live interactions with speakers and other attendees. In the case that SIGGRAPH decides to meet in person, there will also be an in person keynote and reception Sunday, August 7, the day before SIGGRAPH in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<h2><b>Papers Track</b></h2>
<p>We invite original and innovative performance-oriented contributions to the design of algorithms, programming systems, and hardware architectures, for all areas of graphics in the broadest sense, including rendering, virtual and augmented reality, ray tracing, physics, and animation.

<h2><b>Paper Submission Information</b></h2>
<p>HPG has a single track for paper submission. All accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/pub.cfm?id=J1615">Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACMCGIT)</a> journal. </p>
<p>Authors are invited to upload papers electronically in Adobe PDF format by using the <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/HPG_2022/">EG SRM system</a>. Submissions must be anonymous (in which the paper contains no identifying information). Video sequences in standard formats may be submitted using the electronic submission system. Dual submission to other peer-reviewed conferences or journals is not allowed; any paper submitted to another peer-reviewed venue and under consideration during the HPG review cycle will be rejected.</p>
<p>Submitted papers will be evaluated by the International Program Committee and external reviewers using double-blind peer review. There is no rebuttal process. All submissions will either be conditionally accepted with a list of mandatory changes, or rejected. Conditionally accepted papers will receive a talk slot at the conference upon confirmation of author intent to complete the mandatory changes.</p>
<p>Conditionally accepted papers will require a second round of peer review to verify that the mandatory changes have been implemented. This second round will be single-blind. We will offer a fast track option for the second round with a shortened timeline for authors to implement the mandatory changes. Papers that receive final acceptance within the fast track timeline will be provided to the attendees as preprints.</p>
<p>This year, HPG is excited to announce that all accepted papers will be published in open access. The conference has secured the funding required to ensure authors will not have to pay any open access fees.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: papers@highperformancegraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Paper Length and Format</b></h2>
<p>Papers should be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines</a> and use the “acmsmall” style for the PACMCGIT journal.</p>
<p>There is no fixed maximum length for a paper. However, the magnitude of the contribution must be proportional to the length of the paper.</p>
<p>Writing plays an important role in the assessment. Omitting important details or tampering with formatting rules may cause a paper to be graded lower than a longer paper that is clearly written, without being repetitive or verbose.</p>
<h2><b>Submission Guidelines</b></h2>
<p>We try to be as permissive as possible while still taking all reasonable steps to preserve anonymity during the review process. Please do not make public statements on the submission status of your paper until acceptance has been confirmed. Before your paper is accepted:</p>
<ul>
  <li aria-level="1">You may upload a version of your submission, for example as a technical report or to arXiv (or similar services), but please do not mention HPG.</li>
  <li aria-level="1">You may give presentations about your work, without saying it is submitted to HPG.</li>
</ul>
<p> If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.</p>
<h2><b>Hot 3D Systems Track</b></h2>
<p>We invite vendors in the graphics industry to submit presentations of their latest and greatest graphics chips, high-performance software, and system designs. Presentations should be 20 minutes long, with a focus on technical aspects of real products (marketing-oriented talks will not be accepted). Hot 3D presentations are not considered archival publications for the purposes of future submission to peer-reviewed venues.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: hot3d@highperformancegraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Posters</b></h2>
<p>We also invite the submission of posters describing ongoing or late-breaking work. We will dedicate a poster presentation session during the virtual event. In addition, this year we will provide poster authors with the opportunity to optionally present their work during the in-person reception &amp; keynote in Vancouver on August 6 (co-located with SIGGRAPH 2022). Please note that posters are not considered archival publications and thus should not prevent submitting the work therein to other publication venues. </p>
<p>Poster submissions should be sent directly to the following email address: posters@highperformancegraphics.org.</p>
<h2><b>Wolfgang Straßer Best Paper Award</b></h2>
<p>An award of $1000 will be given to the authors of the most outstanding paper presented at the event. The award is based on the accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical concept, the quality and readability of the manuscript, as well as the content and delivery of the verbal presentation. The winner will be chosen by the organizing committee based on audience feedback and will be announced at the end of the conference.</p>
<h2><b>Student Competition</b></h2>
<p>High-Performance Graphics 2022 will feature a research competition for students interested in the above topics. There will be a $750 cash award for the best entry to the competition. Details about the competition and award will be announced at a later date and will be updated on the <a href="https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2022/student-competition/">student competition page</a>.</p>
