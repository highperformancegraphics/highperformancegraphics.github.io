<p>Although HPG is a virtual conference in 2022, we will be hosting an in-person buffet dinner for attendees on the evening of Sunday 7<sup>th</sup> of August 2022 (the day before SIGGRAPH starts).</p>
<p>The event will be held in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FcnvMmE5KzvaMAZY7">the Harbour Centre</a> in downtown Vancouver. There will be an opportunity to dine and mingle with fellow attendees from 5pm in the Harbour Centre Concourse, and there is a dedicated keynote talk and Q&amp;A session (speaker to be announced shortly!) from 7pm in the Fletcher Challenge Theatre.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2022/registration">register</a>, and we look forward to seeing you there!</p>
