<h1>Support the Conference</h1>
<p>High-Performance Graphics is a highly-visible, international forum, with established roots, for exchanging experience and knowledge related to computer graphics algorithms, hardware, and systems. The event offers a unique perspective on graphics by combining discussions and constructive critique of innovative concepts as well as product-level designs.</p>
<p>This year’s event will be held virtually, in continuing response to COVID-19, building on last year’s success where we had 7x greater online viewership than typical physical attendance, had sustained viewership greater than typical physical attendance, thus reached far greater numbers of the community.</p>
<p>Supporting the conference demonstrates leadership and good will in the graphics community and provides an opportunity to recruit among the influential group of researchers, architects, engineers, and students who attend the conference.</p>
