<h1>High-Performance Graphics 2018</h1>
<h4>Thanks for a wonderful conference! See you next year in Strasbourg, France!</h4>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2018! High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, and hardware architecture. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of massively parallel hardware, novel programming models, efficient graphics algorithms, and novel applications.</p>
<p>High-Performance Graphics was founded in 2009 to synthesize and broaden on two important and well-respected conferences in computer graphics: <a href="https://www.graphicshardware.org/"><strong>Graphics Hardware</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/rt08/"><strong>Interactive Ray Tracing</strong></a></p>
<p>The conference will take place at the Segal Building of the Simon Fraser University on August 10-12 in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>Our submission system for papers is now live on the <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/HPG_2018">Eurographics Submission System (SRM)</a>.</p>
