<h1>Call For Participation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce High-Performance Graphics 2018. High-Performance Graphics is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, compilers, parallelism, and hardware architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.</p>
<p>This year, we are particularly encouraging submissions on <strong>high-performance systems in computer vision and machine learning</strong>. In addition, we are introducing a new <strong>short papers track</strong> where authors can publish their recent results, work in progress, and new ideas in a four-page paper format.</p>
<h2><b>Conference Info</b></h2>
<p>High-Performance Graphics is co-sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH and Eurographics. The program features three days of paper and industry presentations, with ample time for discussions during breaks, lunches, and the conference banquet. The conference is co-located with <a href="https://s2018.siggraph.org">SIGGRAPH 2018</a> in Vancouver, British Columbia, and will take place on August 10-12, 2018.</p>
<h2><b>Papers Track</b></h2>

<h2><b>Papers Length and Format</b></h2>
<p>There is no fixed maximum length for a paper. However, the magnitude of the contribution must be proportional to the length of the paper. Papers longer than ten typeset pages in the final format must make a very significant contribution to be accepted. Writing plays an important role in the assessment. Omitting important details or tampering with formatting rules may cause a paper to be graded lower than a longer paper that is clearly written, without being repetitive or verbose. Papers of four or fewer pages will be held to a less strict standard of citation and description of related work (comparison to the strongest alternative techniques is still important, but an exhaustive review is not necessary). Published proceedings will be archived in the ACM and Eurographics Digital Libraries, and will be featured in a special issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques.</p>
<h2><b>Short Papers Track</b></h2>
<p>High-Performance Graphics 2018 also invites research contributions in the form of short papers. The goal of the short papers track is to present early, experimental research to the community. Smaller contributions, ongoing work with early results, implementation notes, and proofs of concept are all candidates for submission to this track. A short paper is also a great venue for sharing negative results&#8212;promising ideas that did not work out in practice. We will include accepted short papers in our proceedings, but with the intention that their publication at HPG does not preclude future submissions, suitably extended to full papers, to HPG and other conferences or journals. Also, all accepted short papers will receive talk slots at the conference.</p>
<p>Short papers should be no more than 4 pages including bibliography. The emphasis should be on presenting ideas and their evaluation, and it is acceptable for a manuscript to have a shorter and less rigorous comparison against related work. The papers committee will automatically consider all rejected full papers for the short papers track.</p>
<h2><b>Paper Submission Info</b></h2>
<p>Authors are invited to upload papers electronically in Adobe PDF format by visiting <a href="/2018/submissions/">the submissions area</a>. We encourage anonymous submissions (in which the paper contains no identifying information) if possible. Video sequences in QuickTime, MPEG, or AVI format may be submitted using the electronic submission system. Dual submission is not allowed; any paper submitted to another venue and under consideration during the HPG review cycle will be rejected. Papers and short papers should be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors">ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines</a> and use the ACM Master Article LaTeX Template for SIGGRAPH proceedings.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: <a href="mailto:papers@highperformancegraphics.org">papers@highperformancegraphics.org</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Hot 3D Systems Track</b></h2>
<p>We invite vendors in the graphics industry to submit presentations of their latest and greatest graphics chips, high-performance software, and system designs. Presentations should be 20 minutes long, technical rather than marketing-oriented, and with a focus on real products. Hot 3D presentations are not considered archival publications for the purposes of future submission to peer-reviewed venues.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: <a href="mailto:hot3d@highperformancegraphics.org">hot3d@highperformancegraphics.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="posters"><b>Posters</b></h2>
<p>We also invite the submission of posters describing ongoing or late-breaking work. In addition to traditional posters, this session will be enhanced to provide opportunities for paper authors to present implementation details or hands-on demonstrations.</p>
<h3><b>Poster Submission Info</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare an extended abstract (one page maximum) that summarizes the work using the paper format described above.</li>
<li>Prepare a high-quality version of the final poster.</li>
<li>Send both items (in PDF format) to <a href="mailto:posters@highperformancegraphics.org">posters@highperformancegraphics.org</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Additional information:</b></h3>
<p>Posters will be exhibited in the break areas throughout the conference. For each poster, we will attempt to make space available for interactive demonstrations (if necessary and only upon request). Poster authors will be responsible for printing the poster, bringing it to the conference, and putting it up. Easels will be provided.</p>
<p>For further information please contact: <a href="mailto:posters@highperformancegraphics.org">posters@highperformancegraphics.org</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Important Dates</b></h2>
<p>All deadlines are at 22:00 UTC/GMT</p>

<h2><b>Wolfgang Strasser Best Paper Award</b></h2>
<p>An award of $750 will be given to the authors of the most outstanding paper presented at the event. The award is based on the accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical concept, the quality and readability of the manuscript, as well as the content and delivery of the verbal presentation. The winner will be chosen by the organizing committee based on audience feedback and will be announced at the end of the conference.</p>
<h2><b>Demonstrations</b></h2>
<p>Presenters and participants are invited to bring prototypes and products for demonstration at the event. Demonstrations will be held during breaks and before and after the sessions. We highly encourage paper authors and industry presenters to demonstrate their systems. Please contact the organizing committee by email at <a href="mailto:general@highperformancegraphics.org">general@highperformancegraphics.org</a> to arrange for space or electrical connections that may be required for your demonstration.</p>
